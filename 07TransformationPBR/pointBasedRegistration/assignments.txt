	- doReg.m, lines 29-41. This file implements
	a PCA-based registration and calls a function 
	executing the ICP (the latter one is commented). 
	It also loads and visualizes
	all data to be registered.
	Test your implementation of the PCA based reg.
	
	- doReg.m: uncomment lines 57-83 and 96-98
	
	- IterativeClosestPoint.m. This file implements
	the ICP algorithm. 
		- implement a function determining the closest points
		to a given point within a certain threshold (l. 153)
		- implement an update of the maximal distance for
		outlier detection based on a statistical analysis
		(ll. 86-101)
		- implement the computation of the motion given two
		sets of (supposedly) corresponding points (l. 133)
		[Hint: Umeyama method implement in pointBasedRegistration.m]
		- apply the motion [R,t] to all points in the
		source set (l. 148)
